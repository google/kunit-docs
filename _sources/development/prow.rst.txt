===============================
Prow Presubmit for KUnit Gerrit
===============================

We, KUnit, use `Prow
<https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow>`_, a Kubernetes
based CI/CD system, for our Presubmit system.

Prow has built in support for Gerrit and GitHub integration. The only thing
needed to run KUnit on Prow is a special test runner container, which we
maintain here: https://kunit.googlesource.com/prow-presubmit.

The Prow config which specifies our container can be found `here
<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra/blob/master/prow/prowjobs/kunit-review.googlesource.com/linux/kunit-linux-config.yaml>`_
in the google-oss prow cluster.

For more information, please refer to our Prow container repo:
