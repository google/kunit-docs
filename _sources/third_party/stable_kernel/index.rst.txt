=================================
Deprecated Version ("kunit/alpha/master")
=================================

Here we have a copy of the documentation taken from the old "alpha" version
KUnit.

You should really prefer using the upstream version if possible, but the alpha
version has some features that still haven't made their way upstream (class
mocking, feature mocking, death tests, etc.)
